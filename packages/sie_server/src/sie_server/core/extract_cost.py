"""Per-item batching cost for the extract path.

The cost surface is consumed by ``BatchFormer`` (see
``core/batcher.py``) when deciding how many extract items can pack
into one forward pass. Two distinct adapter shapes feed this:

1. **Encoder-only** (GLiNER, GLiClass, …) — runtime is dominated by
   the input pass. Char/byte count is a faithful proxy.

2. **Decoder OCR** (LightOnOCR, GLM-OCR, PaddleOCR-VL, …) — runtime
   grows with both input *and* generated output, because KV cache
   inflates as tokens are decoded. Char/byte count under-counts the
   output side, so the batcher over-packs and the GPU stalls or
   OOMs. This is the bug behind issue #33.

The fix (M4 req2 Proj 2 / coordination contract — "same fix is
referenced by #33"): callers operating on decoder-OCR adapters pass
``decoder_max_output_tokens`` so the cost reflects the worst-case
KV growth during decode. Encoder-only callers pass nothing — default
zero preserves the existing behaviour exactly.

The output-token uplift is intentionally additive (not multiplicative)
on the input cost. The two quantities have different units in this
function (byte count for documents, tokens for the decoder output);
adding them is approximation, not exact accounting. It is good
*enough* for the BatchFormer's packing decision — the goal is to stop
the batcher from packing 64 large images into one batch, not to
predict GPU runtime to the millisecond. A future refinement could
introduce per-adapter cost calibration; the current surface
deliberately keeps the API simple so all decoder-OCR adapters can
adopt it without coordinating on a calibration table.
