"""Pool-isolation validator.

A ``GenerationAdapter`` model cannot share a worker pool with non-gen
(encode/score/extract) models. The check is worker-process-local
because ``SIE_POOL`` is read per-worker at boot — there is no central
cross-worker pool registry. The validator fires when configs are added
to a worker's :class:`ModelRegistry` (i.e. at startup config-load and
at hot-reload time).

Rationale (per source spec for the admission-control rollout): mixed-pool fairness across
request shapes is an explicit M5+ concern. For the current horizon
the simpler invariant — a single pool holds a single task class — is
what the gateway's routing and the worker's batch-shape assumptions
already assume. Reject loudly at config load so operators see the
misconfiguration before it surfaces as silent batch-budget thrash.
