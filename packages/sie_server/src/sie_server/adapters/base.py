class ModelAdapter(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for model adapters.

    Each model adapter wraps a specific model architecture and provides
    a consistent interface for loading, inference, and unloading.

    Adapters are resolved in this order (see DESIGN.md Section 7.2):
    1. base_model: inherit adapter from another model's config
    2. adapter: adapter.py:ClassName (file in model directory)
    3. adapter: sie_server.adapters.module:ClassName (built-in adapter)

    Memory Management Contract:
        Adapters are responsible for fully releasing GPU memory in unload().
        After unload() returns, the device memory should be reclaimable.

        For PyTorch-based adapters, this means:
        1. Delete model references (del self._model, etc.)
        2. Run gc.collect() to force Python to release objects
        3. Call torch.cuda.empty_cache() or torch.mps.empty_cache()

        Non-PyTorch adapters (e.g., SGLang) should use their own cleanup
        mechanism (e.g., engine.shutdown()) that fully releases memory.

    Main Thread Requirement:
        Some adapters (e.g., SGLang) use signal handlers that only work in
        the main thread. Set requires_main_thread = True for these adapters.
        The registry will run load() directly in the event loop instead of
        in a thread pool, which blocks but ensures main thread execution.

    Device-Aware Factory Method:
        Adapters can override create_for_device() to return different adapter
        implementations based on device compatibility. Flash adapters inherit
        from FlashBaseAdapter which provides declarative fallback via ClassVar
        properties (fallback_adapter_path, fallback_kwargs_overrides).
