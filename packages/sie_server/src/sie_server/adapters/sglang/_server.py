"""Shared SGLang server subprocess plumbing.

Used by both the embedding adapter (``embedding.py``) and the generation
adapter (``generation.py``). The two adapters launch the same
``sglang.launch_server`` binary with different flags, but the
port-allocation, subprocess-supervision, health-polling, and termination
patterns are identical — hence this module.

This module deliberately contains no model-specific logic; it just owns the
lifecycle of a single SGLang HTTP server child process.

    call are excluded via ``_RESERVED_PORTS`` so concurrent in-process
    loads can't both pick the same one. The scan start is also randomized
    within the range so two near-simultaneous calls are unlikely to probe
    the same port in the same order. The race against *external* processes
    (outside this interpreter) remains inherent — there is no way to
    atomically reserve a TCP port without holding it open — but the common
    in-process collision is closed. Reserved ports leak intentionally:
    once handed out a port stays excluded for the process lifetime (the
