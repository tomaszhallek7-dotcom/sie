"""Health check endpoints for SIE Server.

Provides Kubernetes-compatible probes:
- /healthz: Startup/liveness probe - is the process alive? (CPU only, cheap)
- /livez:   GPU-aware liveness probe - can the device still run kernels?
- /readyz:  Readiness probe - is the server ready to accept traffic right now?

See DESIGN.md Section 3.1 for specification.

    Unlike /healthz (process-alive only), this exercises the GPU with a tiny CUDA
    sync. A wedged CUDA context (``device-side assert``) is unrecoverable in
    PyTorch, so failing liveness lets the kubelet restart the pod — the only path
    back to a serving worker (see issue #1025).

    It deliberately does NOT consult the lifecycle ready flag, so graceful
    shutdown draining (when the worker marks itself not-ready) never trips a
    restart. Wire this to the K8s ``livenessProbe`` with a tolerant
    ``failureThreshold`` so a momentarily busy GPU is not mistaken for a wedge.

    Returns:
        200 OK with "ok" body if the GPU can run a kernel (or this is a CPU
        worker). 503 Service Unavailable with "gpu unhealthy" if wedged.

    Returns 200 if the server is ready to accept traffic.
    Used by Kubernetes to determine if traffic should be routed to this pod.

    Readiness has two conditions:
    - Lifecycle state, managed by the lifespan handler: ready after startup
      completes, not ready during shutdown (draining in-flight requests).
    - GPU health: a tiny CUDA sync confirms the device can still run kernels. A
      wedged CUDA context (``device-side assert``) keeps returning sticky errors
      from every inference while a process-alive check stays green, so without
      this the gateway would keep routing to a dead worker (see issue #1025).

        200 OK with "ok" body if ready.
