"""Strict streaming parser for Qwen/Hermes-style tool-call tags.

The SGLang adapter yields text deltas. Qwen3 chat templates encode tool calls as
``<tool_call>{"name":"...","arguments":{...}}</tool_call>`` inside that text
stream. This module converts those tagged regions into the worker/gateway
``tool_call_delta`` shape while preserving surrounding prose as normal text.

This first implementation emits arguments atomically when the closing tag arrives.
It is intentionally strict: malformed JSON or missing ``name``/``arguments``
turns into a terminal ``MODEL_OUTPUT_PARSE_ERROR`` chunk.

For streaming ``n>1`` the parser maintains independent per-candidate state
keyed by ``chunk.choice_index`` (H5): each candidate's tool-call deltas
surface tagged with the same ``choice_index`` they came in on, so the
gateway can fan tool calls out per candidate.
