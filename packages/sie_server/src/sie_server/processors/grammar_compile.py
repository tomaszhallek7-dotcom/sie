"""Outlines compile wrapper for grammar validation.

The worker compiles the grammar once per ``(tokenizer, schema)`` pair
before forwarding the raw schema/regex to SGLang's ``/generate``
endpoint. SGLang itself runs the Outlines backend internally when
launched with ``--grammar-backend outlines``; the worker-side compile
serves two roles:

1. **Fast failure**: surface ``grammar_compile_failed`` as a worker-side
   chunk envelope before publishing inference work to SGLang. SGLang's
   own compile errors arrive as HTTP 500s and are harder to attribute.
2. **Cache key**: validation must succeed before the cache is
   populated, so a hit confirms the schema is well-formed for the
   tokenizer that hashed into the key.

The compile result is stored as a sentinel (``True``) — the gateway-to-SGLang
wire shape carries the **raw** schema/regex, not a compiled processor,
because SGLang owns its own per-engine cache. If a future backend
needs a pre-compiled processor object the wrapper can return it
instead; the cache value is opaque to :mod:`grammar_cache`.

Outlines API surface
--------------------
``outlines-core`` (preloaded in ``packages/sie_server/bundles/sglang.yaml``)
exposes its public API differently across versions. The wrapper tries
the modern ``outlines.processors`` entry point first and falls back to
older ``outlines_core.fsm`` names if that fails — both are documented to
build a regex-driven FSM against a tokenizer. The exact symbol used is
abstracted behind :func:`_resolve_outlines_factories` so future versions
can override without touching :class:`StreamingProcessor`.

Tokenizer adapter
-----------------
``JSONLogitsProcessor`` / ``RegexLogitsProcessor`` do **not** accept a raw
HuggingFace tokenizer — they expect an Outlines ``Tokenizer`` adapter
(``outlines.models.tokenizer.Tokenizer``) that exposes ``.vocabulary``.
The FSM build (``RegexGuide.from_regex``) reads ``tokenizer.vocabulary``
directly. A raw transformers tokenizer has no such attribute; under
``transformers>=5`` the fast tokenizer is a ``TokenizersBackend`` and the
unadapted access fails with ``'TokenizersBackend' object has no attribute
'vocabulary'`` — the historical reason Qwen3.5 was pinned to XGrammar.
:func:`_adapt_tokenizer` wraps the raw tokenizer in Outlines'
``TransformerTokenizer`` (which fills ``.vocabulary`` from ``get_vocab()``,
still present in transformers v5) before handing it to the factories —
mirroring exactly what SGLang's own Outlines backend does internally
(``OutlinesGrammarBackend`` constructs ``TransformerTokenizer(tokenizer)``).
