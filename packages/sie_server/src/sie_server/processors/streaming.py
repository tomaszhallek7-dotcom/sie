"""Streaming processor for generation work items.

The ``StreamingProcessor`` is the gen-only branch behind the
``MessageProcessor`` seam introduced in ``NatsPullLoop._process_messages``.

The streaming rollout (this revision) drives the adapter as an async iterator:

- pull one work item
- generate a worker-side ``attempt_id``
- iterate ``adapter.generate(...)``, **coalescing** yields by time/count
- publish each coalesced batch as a chunk envelope on
  ``_INBOX.{router_id}.{request_id}``
- on the iterator's terminal yield, publish a ``{done: true}`` chunk
  with ``usage`` / ``finish_reason`` / ``ttft_ms`` and ACK the JetStream
  work message
- on cancel (set externally by ``NatsPullLoop`` from the cluster-scope
  ``cancel.>`` subscription), close the iterator, flush a terminal
  ``{finish_reason: "cancelled", done: true}`` chunk, and ACK
- on sustained transport failure (>3 publish errors within 1s, or per-
  request queue cap >64 unsent), publish a final ``{error,
  code: "transport_failure", done: true}`` chunk and ACK

The chunk envelope is *not* the walking-skeleton ``WorkResult`` shape — see
``product/plans/m4-req2-generate-issues/02-streaming-async-iterator.md``
§2.2 of the plan for the discriminated wire shape:

    { kind: "chunk", request_id, attempt_id, seq, text_delta,
      is_first?, done, finish_reason?, usage?, ttft_ms?, error? }

        On failure (timeout, validation error, missing Outlines) publishes
        a terminal-error chunk on ``reply_subject`` and ACKs the work
        message (failure is delivered cleanly via the error chunk —
        redelivery cannot help fix the schema). Returns ``False`` so
        the caller skips :meth:`_stream_generate`. Returns ``True`` on
        success.

        The compile runs only for cache misses so a steady-state
        request mix (a few schemas, many requests) pays the compile
        cost once per (tokenizer, schema) pair. The 5-second cap is
        the contractual limit from §4.6 of the parent plan.
