"""Build constrained-decoding grammars that enforce OpenAI ``tool_choice``.

The ``tool_choice: "auto"`` path lets the model decide whether to emit
``<tool_call>`` blocks. ``"required"`` (the model MUST call some tool)
and the named form (``{"type":"function","function":{"name": X}}`` — the
model MUST call tool ``X``) need *enforcement*. The SIE worker renders
the chat template itself and calls SGLang's raw ``/generate`` endpoint,
which has no OpenAI ``tool_choice`` parameter — so the only lever is
constrained decoding via a grammar on ``sampling_params`` (``regex`` /
``ebnf`` / ``json_schema``, see the SGLang generation adapter).

This module builds a ``regex`` :class:`GrammarSpec` that constrains the
output to one or more well-formed tool-call blocks in the model's
configured on-wire format (:data:`ToolCallFormat`), optionally pinned to
a single function name. Regex (rather than EBNF) keeps the constraint
small and predictable; both are supported by the xgrammar backend.

GPU-VERIFY: the patterns here are correct by construction and unit-tested
for shape, but have NOT been run end-to-end against xgrammar + Qwen3.5 on
GPU. One verification pass (see ``deploy/demo-gcp/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md``
§1) should confirm the backend accepts the pattern and the model
terminates cleanly before relying on forced ``tool_choice`` in
production. The failure mode if a pattern is rejected is a clean
``grammar_compile_failed`` terminal chunk, not a crash.
