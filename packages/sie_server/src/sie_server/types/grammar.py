"""Worker-side wire types for structured-output grammar specs.

The gateway serialises one ``GrammarSpec`` per ``/v1/generate`` or
``/v1/chat/completions`` request and forwards it to the worker over the
JetStream work envelope. The worker deserialises into the matching
:class:`GrammarSpec` and consults the per-process LRU
(:mod:`sie_server.processors.grammar_cache`) before compiling an
Outlines logits processor.

The on-the-wire shape mirrors the Rust ``GrammarSpec`` enum in
``packages/sie_gateway/src/queue/publisher.rs`` (a serde ``#[serde(tag =
"kind")]`` map). Validating the wire shape is the caller's
responsibility — :class:`GrammarSpec` is a plain dataclass, not a
parser.

Hashing
-------
:func:`hash_grammar` produces a stable, short fingerprint of the schema
payload used as the schema component of the cache key. The full cache
key (``(tokenizer_hash, schema_hash, backend)``) is assembled in
:class:`~sie_server.processors.streaming.StreamingProcessor`; this
module owns the ``schema_hash`` portion only so changes to the schema
representation don't ripple into the cache key shape.

The blake2b digest is truncated to 16 hex characters (~63 bits of
entropy). That is wildly more than enough to avoid collisions among
the ≤64 cache entries any one worker holds at a time, and keeps the
key compact enough for log lines / debug dumps.

            ``value`` is a string (regex pattern or EBNF source).
            Mutual exclusivity is enforced by the gateway before this

            ``regex`` and ``ebnf``. The gateway has already enforced
            the safety caps (payload size, schema depth, regex /
            EBNF source length) so the worker can compile without
            re-validating.
        label: Optional human-readable name surfaced from the OpenAI
            ``response_format.json_schema.name`` field. Used for log
            lines and metric labels; never affects the compile result.

            otherwise advisory.

    The hash deliberately omits ``label`` and ``strict`` — a label change
    does not invalidate a compiled processor, and the LRU shouldn't
    multiply by label cardinality.

    ``kind`` IS folded in: a ``regex`` and an ``ebnf`` (or ``json_schema``)
    can share the same ``value`` string yet compile to entirely different
    processors. Hashing ``value`` alone made e.g. ``regex "[a-z]+"`` and
    ``ebnf "[a-z]+"`` collide, so an ebnf "ready" cache entry would satisfy
    a regex lookup and skip the regex's own Outlines preflight — admitting a
    malformed regex. Prefixing the kind keeps each kind in its own keyspace.

    JSON-schema values are serialised with ``sort_keys=True`` and the
    compact separator so logically equivalent dicts with different key
    orders or whitespace map to the same hash. Regex / EBNF strings hash
