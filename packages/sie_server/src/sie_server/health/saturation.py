"""Saturation hysteresis state machine.

The routing rollout surfaces a boolean ``saturated`` flag on the worker's status
payload (WS ``/ws/status`` and, when ``SIE_HEALTH_NATS=1``, also on
``sie.health.{worker_id}``). The gateway uses this to exclude the
worker from the HRW direct-dispatch ring.

The flag is governed by a two-threshold hysteresis to avoid thrashing
under oscillation around a single setpoint:

* When ``in_flight / capacity >= HIGH`` (default 90%), the worker
  flips to ``saturated = True``.
* It stays saturated until ``in_flight / capacity <= LOW``
  (default 70%), at which point it flips back to ``False``.

The state machine is intentionally pure (no I/O, no clock) so it can be
unit-tested in isolation; the call sites in ``nats_pull_loop`` and
``api/ws.py`` drive it from the existing in-flight counter.

The admission-control rollout swaps the input from ``in_flight / max_batch_requests``
to ``kv_reserved / kv_budget`` — the state machine itself stays the same.
