"""Docker image tests.

These tests build and run the actual SIE Docker image to verify:
- Dockerfile builds correctly
- Container can start and become healthy
- Model downloads work (cache directory permissions)
- Basic inference works

Regression test for: https://github.com/superlinked/sie-internal/issues/10

Run with: pytest -m "docker"
