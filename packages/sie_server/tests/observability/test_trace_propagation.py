"""W3C Trace Context propagation through the worker streaming processor (M5).

These tests pin the contract that
:meth:`sie_server.processors.streaming.StreamingProcessor.process`
extracts a parent context from the work-envelope ``traceparent`` /
``tracestate`` fields, opens a ``worker.streaming_processor`` span as
its child, and attaches the standard ``sie.*`` attributes.

The propagation contract is what makes the cross-process trace tree
join: the gateway publishes the envelope with its own span context
serialised into ``traceparent``, the worker reads those bytes back
into a parent ``Context``, and the worker span becomes a child of
the gateway span. Without this round-trip the worker's spans would
form a disconnected root tree and the gateway-and-worker latency
breakdown would be impossible to correlate.

The tests use an :class:`InMemorySpanExporter` (no network) so they
are deterministic and run as part of the unit suite.
