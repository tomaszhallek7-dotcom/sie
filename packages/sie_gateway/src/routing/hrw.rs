//! Highest-Random-Weight (rendezvous) hashing for direct-dispatch routing.
//!
//! Given a request hash and a snapshot of candidate workers, pick the
//! single worker whose combined hash with the request key is largest.
//! This is `O(n)` per pick, stable across all callers without
//! coordination, and degrades gracefully when workers come and go
//! (only `1/n` of keys move on membership change).
//!
//! Snapshots are immutable. The
//! [`crate::state::worker_registry::WorkerRegistry`] owns the source
//! of truth; this module just consumes a borrowed slice of
//! `(worker_id, worker_id_hash)` pairs.
