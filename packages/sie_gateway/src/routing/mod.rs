//! Direct-dispatch routing.
//!
//! Public API:
//! - [`pick_worker`]: HRW (rendezvous-hash) selection for a `(model, pool)` ring.
//! - [`key::resolve`]: priority-ordered routing-key extraction + xxh3 hashing.
//! - [`fmt_key_hash`]: privacy-safe log formatter (`xxh:XXXXXXXX`).
//! - [`log_raw_keys_enabled`] / [`warn_if_raw_logging_enabled`]: opt-in raw-key logging.
//!
//! **Privacy contract.** Raw routing-key strings are never logged at the
//! default tracing level. All code paths in this module that surface a key
//! must go through [`fmt_key_hash`] unless [`log_raw_keys_enabled`] returns
//! `true` (gated by `SIE_ROUTING_LOG_RAW=1`, with a loud startup warning).
//!
//! **Compile-time gate: `raw-routing-logs` Cargo feature.** The
//! `SIE_ROUTING_LOG_RAW=1` runtime opt-in is itself gated by the
//! `raw-routing-logs` Cargo feature (off by default). In release builds
//! without `raw-routing-logs`, raw keys cannot appear in logs regardless
//! of env var — [`log_raw_keys_enabled`] is a stub that always returns
//! `false`, [`warn_if_raw_logging_enabled`] is a no-op, and the
//! [`key::RoutingKeyResolved::raw_for_debug`] field does not exist on the
//! struct. Production deploys SHOULD build without this feature.
