# SIE Architecture

This document describes the current deployed architecture of the SIE control plane and inference edge. It is code-audited against the `sie-internal` monorepo (`packages/sie_gateway`, `packages/sie_config`, `packages/sie_sdk`). Every behavior described here is what the code does on this branch.

Top-level summary:

- `sie-gateway` (Rust) is the inference edge. It is queue-only for inference and serves read-side configuration.
- `sie-config` (Python) is the configuration control plane. It owns writes, persistence, and delta publication.
- Workers execute inference.
- NATS carries runtime messaging. JetStream carries inference work and the DLQ. Core pub/sub carries config deltas, worker health, and inference results.
- Kubernetes coordinates pool state. It is not on the inference request path.

The gateway's contract with `sie-config` is three shapes. Everything else below elaborates on them.

1. `GET /v1/configs/export` — full snapshot, consumed on cold start and on drift detection.
2. `GET /v1/configs/epoch` — monotonic integer, polled every 30s to detect drift.
3. `sie.config.models._all` (NATS Core) — live deltas; missed ones are caught by (2).

The gateway's contract with admin tooling for post-write readiness is `GET /v1/configs/models/{id}/status`.

## 1. Services

| Service | Role | Publishes | Subscribes / Consumes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client SDK | Submits inference requests | HTTP inference requests | HTTP inference responses |
| Admin / deploy tooling | Mutates config, reads control-plane state | HTTP config requests | HTTP config responses |
| `sie-gateway` (Rust) | Queue-only inference edge; read-side config; pool management; health and metrics | Queue work items, inference results acks, read-side config responses, pool state changes, DLQ republishes, metrics | Client inference requests, worker results, worker health, config deltas, K8s pool state |
| `sie-config` (Python) | Config control plane; single writer | Config write responses, read responses, snapshot/export responses, config deltas (NATS) | Admin/config-management requests |
| Workers | Execute inference | Result messages, health signals | Queue work items |
| NATS / JetStream | Message bus | — | — |
| Kubernetes API | Pool coordination | — | — |

Key terms used throughout this document:

- **Bundle**: a model-compatibility grouping. Answers "which workers can serve this model?". Defined by a `name`, a `priority`, and an `adapters[]` list of Python module paths. The source of truth is `sie-config`'s filesystem (image-baked at `SIE_BUNDLES_DIR`, default `/app/bundles`); `sie-config` loads them at startup to drive write validation and exposes them via `GET /v1/configs/bundles` + `GET /v1/configs/bundles/{id}`. The gateway no longer bakes its own copy: `state::config_bootstrap::BootstrapClient::fetch_bundles` pulls them at startup and installs them into `ModelRegistry` via `install_bundles` before any model fetch. Neither service *persists* bundles, and there is no `POST /v1/configs/bundles` on either side — bundle changes are a `sie-config` redeploy and the gateway picks them up on its next bootstrap (or on the next poller-driven catch-up; see §4.2).
- **Pool**: an operational routing group of workers managed by the gateway. Answers "which compatible workers should this request be queued to right now?". Pools are a runtime concept stored in Kubernetes.
- **Config store**: `sie-config`'s backing store for persisted state. Per-model YAML files plus a plain-text monotonic `epoch` counter, laid out as `{base}/models/{id-with-/-as-__}.yaml` and `{base}/epoch`. The backend is selected by the `SIE_CONFIG_STORE_DIR` scheme: a local path (default — backed by an opt-in PVC in Helm), `s3://…`, or `gs://…`.
- **Config epoch**: a monotonic integer. Every `sie-config` write that creates new profiles bumps it by one. The gateway tracks it locally as `ConfigEpoch` for drift detection.
- **`bundle_config_hash`**: a content hash over the routable-profile fields (`adapter_path`, `max_batch_tokens`, `compute_precision`, `adapter_options`) for every model whose adapters match a bundle. Used by admin tooling and workers to tell "has this worker picked up the new config for this bundle yet?"

## 2. Inference Request Path

1. Client SDK sends HTTP to the gateway:
   - `POST /v1/encode/{*model}`
   - `POST /v1/score/{*model}`
   - `POST /v1/extract/{*model}`
   - `POST /v1/embeddings` — OpenAI-compatible JSON surface; the gateway accepts **string** or **list of strings** for `input`, supports `encoding_format=float` (default) or `base64`, translates to an internal **`POST /v1/encode/{model}`** with `items[].text` and `params.output_types=["dense"]`, then maps encode `items[].dense` vectors into OpenAI `data[].embedding` plus a rough `usage` estimate. Token-id / nested-array inputs are rejected with **`400`**.
2. Gateway resolves the request to a model, a bundle, a machine profile, and a queue pool using its in-memory registry.
3. Gateway publishes work to JetStream on `sie.work.{model}.{pool}`.
4. A matching worker consumes the work item and executes inference.
5. Worker publishes the result on `_INBOX.{router_id}.{request_id}` (NATS Core).
6. Gateway collects the result and returns the HTTP response.

Rules enforced on the inference path:

- The inference hot path does not call `sie-config`.
- The inference hot path is queue-only. There is no direct-HTTP fallback. `src/handlers/proxy.rs` is the queue-submission handler despite its name.
- If the queue transport is unavailable (no usable NATS client at init), the gateway returns `503`. It does not fall back to direct mode.
- Unknown model ids fast-fail with `404` whenever the in-memory `ModelRegistry` has been populated (either by the filesystem seed or by a successful bootstrap / delta from `sie-config`). In the pre-bootstrap edge case where the registry is still empty — no seed, no export applied yet — the proxy falls back to the caller-supplied bundle (or `"default"`) so an unseeded gateway can still publish work to a cold pool that a caller pinned via `X-SIE-Pool`. Once any model is registered, this fallback is disabled and the 404 contract applies.
- On scale-from-zero — i.e. no healthy worker registered for the `(bundle, machine_profile)` tuple and the caller did not pin an explicit pool — the gateway returns `202 provisioning` with `Retry-After: 120` and records pending demand for KEDA. This applies whether or not the caller set `X-SIE-MACHINE-PROFILE`; default-routing clients get the same contract as profile-pinned clients.
- On no-consumer conditions for the JetStream publish the gateway returns `503` with `Retry-After: 120`. On backpressure conditions the gateway returns `503` with `Retry-After: 5`.
- On queue result timeouts the gateway returns `503` with `X-SIE-Error-Code: MODEL_LOADING` and `Retry-After: 5`. The most common trigger is a worker cold-loading the target model on demand (worker NAKs the JetStream message and redelivers after load); the SDK retries this under the same `provision_timeout_s` budget used for worker-emitted `MODEL_LOADING` responses.
- When workers report failure on every item of a batch with the **same retryable error code** in `WorkResult.error_code`, the gateway translates that into a `503` with the SDK-expected envelope (`error.code`, `Retry-After`, `X-SIE-Error-Code`) so the SDK auto-retries. Currently recognised codes: `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` (worker-side OOM recovery exhausted — `Retry-After: 5`), `MODEL_LOADING`, and `LORA_LOADING`. **Mixed batches** (different codes per item) keep going through the legacy `500 all_items_failed` path with per-item `code` fields exposed in `details[]`, so callers can see exactly which items hit which failure mode. Workers reporting `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` are **not** marked unhealthy — losing an allocation race is not a worker-health signal.
- When **every** failed item carries **`MODEL_LOAD_FAILED`**, the gateway returns **`502 Bad Gateway`** with the SDK-style **`error`** object (`code`, `message`, `error_class`, `attempts`, `permanent`) — matching the terminal model-load contract consumed by SDK retry logic (no `Retry-After`; the SDK must not burn the `MODEL_LOADING` retry budget). The gateway synthesises conservative `attempts` / `permanent` fields on this queue path when the worker payload does not carry registry-shaped failure metadata.

Encode / extract tuning fields (`output_types`, `instruction`, `options`, `labels`, `output_schema`, `is_query`) are read **only** from the nested JSON **`params`** object (and the msgpack analogue: a top-level **`params`** map). The score path continues to read `query` / `instruction` / `options` at the top level of the request body, matching `sie_server`.

Work-item and result payloads on the wire are **msgpack** (`rmp_serde`). JSON is used only for the HTTP request/response envelope when the client negotiates it (via `Content-Type` / `Accept`); the gateway transcodes msgpack ↔ JSON at the edge so the hot path between gateway and workers is always binary.

Gateway-generated **JSON error** bodies (validation, routing, auth, config read, pools) use a FastAPI-like envelope **`{"detail":{"code":"<STABLE_CODE>","message":"…", …}}`**. Extra diagnostic keys (e.g. `compatible_bundles`, `gpu`, `model`) live **inside** `detail` when present. This is intentionally **not** the same shape as SDK retry contracts, which remain **`{"error":{"code","message"}}`** for **503** retryable worker signals and **`502`** **`MODEL_LOAD_FAILED`**. **202 provisioning** and **200** success payloads keep their existing top-level shapes.

## 3. Configuration Write Path

All config mutations go to `sie-config`. The gateway has no write handler.

1. Admin or deploy tooling sends `POST /v1/configs/models` with a model config YAML body to `sie-config`. Auth: `_check_write_auth` (`packages/sie_config/src/sie_config/config_api.py`) requires a bearer matching `SIE_ADMIN_TOKEN` when that variable is set; if `SIE_ADMIN_TOKEN` is unset and `SIE_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, writes are rejected with `403` (the inference token never grants write access); if neither token is set (dev/local only) writes are accepted unauthenticated. Production deployments always set `SIE_ADMIN_TOKEN`.
2. **Pre-lock stage** (outside the per-app write lock, on the FastAPI event loop): parse the YAML body and — when a top-level `sie_id` is present — run `_validate_model_id` (regex + `..`/`\\` rejection + `status`-suffix rejection). Reject invalid input with `400` before any state is touched.
3. **Critical section** under `_get_write_lock` (a lazy, per-app `asyncio.Lock` stored on `app.state`):
   1. `ModelRegistry.validate_model_config` — pure check against the in-memory registry (no mutation), run under the registry's internal `threading.RLock`. Validation rejects any write whose post-state resolves to zero routable bundles (`422`), so an `extends`-only profile cannot land a brand-new model that no worker bundle can serve. Appending a new `extends`-only profile to an already-routable model is allowed.
   2. **Compute `created_profiles` vs `existing_profiles_skipped`.** The write is treated as append-only: profiles already present in the registry with a compatible body are reported as skipped, not rewritten. If there are no new profiles *and* at least one skip, an on-disk conflict check compares the incoming YAML against `ConfigStore`'s existing file for this model (guards against disk drift from the in-memory registry).
   3. **Persist to disk** via `ConfigStore.write_model` — **only if there are new profiles (`created_profiles` non-empty) and a `ConfigStore` is configured**. The persisted YAML is the result of a merge with the existing stored document (when one exists): new top-level fields are added, missing top-level fields are preserved, and same-key mutations to existing non-`profiles` metadata are rejected with `409 content_conflict` (the API is append-only for metadata too). Incoming `profiles` are merged profile-by-profile. No-op replays skip this step entirely. On the `LocalBackend`, `write_model` is atomic (`tempfile.mkstemp` → write → `fsync` → `Path.replace`, in `packages/sie_sdk/src/sie_sdk/storage.py`); on `S3Backend` / `GCSBackend` the write is a single object-store PUT (last-writer-wins, atomic at the object level).
   4. **Mutate the in-memory registry** via `ModelRegistry.add_model_config`. Runs under the registry's `RLock`; uses atomic dict-swap semantics so lock-free readers (e.g. `GET /models`, `GET /bundles`) never observe a torn state. The registry re-runs `_validate_config_locked` internally, so validation effectively runs twice (once from step 3.1, once from inside `add_model_config`) — the doubled cost is negligible and the redundancy is intentional.
   5. **Increment the epoch** via `ConfigStore.increment_epoch` — **only if `created_profiles` is non-empty and a `ConfigStore` is configured**. Read-modify-write; single-writer is enforced by the outer lock. `increment_epoch` always goes through plain `write_text` (no CAS), so running multiple `sie-config` replicas against a shared store would be unsafe — see §10 on single-replica deployment.
   6. **Publish NATS deltas** via `NatsPublisher.publish_config_notification` — **only if a publisher is configured, currently connected, and `created_profiles` is non-empty**. If the publisher is configured but not currently connected, the handler returns `503` instead of publishing. On `PartialPublishError` the handler emits a `nats_publish_partial` entry in `warnings` naming the failed bundles; on any other publish exception it emits a generic `nats_publish_failed` warning. The published `model_config` body is the merged YAML (not the partial incoming body), so every subscriber replays the same authoritative state sie-config wrote to disk.
4. `sie-config` returns a JSON response: `model_id`, `created_profiles`, `existing_profiles_skipped`, `warnings`, `routable_bundles_by_profile`, `router_id`.

Ordering guarantees:

- Within the critical section, persist (3.3) happens before registry mutation (3.4). A disk-write failure aborts the write before the in-memory state changes, so a later process restart cannot observe a registry-only model that has no backing YAML.
- The epoch is bumped strictly inside the lock, after a successful persist and registry apply. Two concurrent writers cannot lose an epoch bump.
- NATS publish happens inside the lock, so the `(bundle_id, epoch)` pairs reach the wire in strict monotonic order per bundle.
- No-op replays (every profile already present, no `created_profiles`) skip disk, epoch-bump, and NATS publish entirely. The response still returns normally, reporting `existing_profiles_skipped` with an empty `created_profiles`.
- `GET /v1/configs/export` also takes the same lock (`_check_write_auth` — admin-only), so every exported snapshot is a real serialization point: `(epoch, models)` always corresponds to a state that existed between two writes.

NATS publish behavior:

- One `ConfigNotification` message is published per affected bundle to `sie.config.models.{bundle_id}`, and a byte-identical copy to `sie.config.models._all`.
- If publish fails for a subset of bundles, `NatsPublisher` continues publishing to the remaining bundles and raises `PartialPublishError` at the end with the failed bundle list. The write itself is still durable on disk. The response `warnings` field names the failed bundles; affected workers will stay on the previous epoch until the gateway's poller triggers a re-export.

Idempotency:

- Writes accept an `Idempotency-Key` header. The state (`_IdempotencyState` on `request.app.state`) holds an LRU response cache and per-key `asyncio.Event`s for in-flight deduplication.
- A duplicate key with the same body returns the cached response without re-executing.
- A duplicate key with a different body returns `422 idempotency_mismatch`.
- A duplicate key whose cached response has been LRU-evicted between the in-flight wait and the cache read returns a synthesized `200 idempotent_replay_evicted` response. The write is never executed twice for the same key.

Model-ID validation (`_validate_model_id`):

- Rejects path-traversal patterns (`..`, `\\`).
- Requires `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9._/-]*$`.
- Rejects IDs equal to `status` or ending in `/status`, because the gateway's `GET /v1/configs/models/{*id}` uses a `/status` suffix for worker-ack reporting and an overlapping model ID would make that URL ambiguous.

The gateway does not serve `POST /v1/configs/models`. The route is not registered. Axum returns `405 Method Not Allowed`. There is no `410 Gone` shim and no redirect body.

## 4. Gateway Bootstrap and Recovery

The gateway does not block startup on `sie-config`. Startup is:

1. Construct `ModelRegistry`. In default Helm deploys, `SIE_BUNDLES_DIR` and `SIE_MODELS_DIR` are unset and the registry's filesystem reload is a no-op (warns once that the dirs are missing, then proceeds with empty bundle and model maps). The optional `gateway.embeddedConfigs` / `gateway.configMap` overlays mount a ConfigMap at `/configs/{bundles,models}` and set those env vars; in that mode the registry loads the seed before bootstrap runs.
2. Initialize the other runtime subsystems that do not depend on `sie-config`: NATS manager (with config-delta subscription), worker health manager, optional filesystem config watcher, pool manager / K8s backend, and worker discovery.
3. Spawn two independent background tasks: `state::config_bootstrap::spawn_bootstrap_retry` and `state::config_poller::spawn`. They share the same `ModelRegistry`, `ConfigEpoch` (monotonic model-write counter), and `BundlesHash` (sha256 fingerprint of `sie-config`'s loaded bundle set). The poller skips its first tick (one `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL` grace) so the initial bootstrap attempt can run first, and then reconciles on every subsequent tick regardless of whether the bootstrap task has completed yet.
4. Bind the HTTP listener. Kubernetes probes use plain-text endpoints implemented in `handlers/health.rs`:
   - **`GET /healthz`** — liveness. Always **`200 OK`** with body **`ok`** and **`Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`** (same wire shape as `sie_server`'s `/healthz`).
   - **`GET /readyz`** — readiness for **routing traffic to this gateway process**. Returns **`200 OK`** + **`ok`** once the gateway listener is serving. It is intentionally independent of worker health and `sie-config` reachability: a gateway with zero healthy workers must still receive the first inference request so it can return `202 + Retry-After` and emit `sie_gateway_pending_demand` for scale-from-zero. Worker availability is exposed on **`GET /health`** and by the inference response path itself.

The bootstrap/poller tasks are spawned **before** the HTTP listener binds, so requests hitting a freshly-bound replica can observe either filesystem-seed-only state or a partially-applied snapshot depending on timing. That is by design. **`/readyz` does not wait for control-plane sync** (see §11 caveat 3); bootstrap completeness is tracked via **`GET /v1/configs/models/{id}/status`**, **`sie_gateway_config_bootstrap_degraded`**, and **`sie_gateway_config_epoch`** — not by `/readyz` alone.

### 4.1 Bootstrap retry

`state::config_bootstrap::spawn_bootstrap_retry` runs `bootstrap_once` in a retry loop until the first success, then exits. Ongoing reconciliation after that point is the poller's job (§4.2).

Startup short-circuits:

- If `SIE_CONFIG_SERVICE_URL` is unset, the task logs and returns immediately — there is nothing to bootstrap against. The gateway runs filesystem-seed-only.
- If constructing the HTTP client fails, the task sets `sie_gateway_config_bootstrap_degraded` to `1` and returns; it does not retry.

`bootstrap_once` runs a three-call sequence, authenticated with `SIE_ADMIN_TOKEN` as a bearer token on `SIE_CONFIG_SERVICE_URL`:

1. `GET /v1/configs/epoch` — reads the bundle-set fingerprint BEFORE we fetch bundles, so the hash we store reflects the state we're about to catch up from (the pre-fetch ordering is load-bearing — see below).
2. `GET /v1/configs/bundles` and per-id `GET /v1/configs/bundles/{id}` — the two-phase bundle fetch. The YAML bodies are parsed into `BundleInfo` values and handed to `ModelRegistry::install_bundles`, which atomically replaces the registry's bundle set and recomputes every model's bundle associations.
3. `GET /v1/configs/export` — replays every exported model config into `ModelRegistry` via `add_model_config`. Malformed or unparseable entries are logged and counted as `failed`; they do not abort the loop. Export rows that carry no config body are skipped and are *not* counted as failed.

Returns `BootstrapOutcome { epoch, bundles_hash, applied, failed, total }`.

- If **any** model entry failed (`outcome.failed > 0`), `bootstrap_once` returns `BootstrapError::PartialApply` and **advances neither `ConfigEpoch` nor `BundlesHash`**. The poller will detect drift on the next tick and retry.
- If all entries applied, `bootstrap_once` advances `ConfigEpoch` via `set_max(outcome.epoch)`, stores `outcome.bundles_hash` into `BundlesHash`, and the retry task exits.

Why fetch `/epoch` BEFORE `/bundles`: if a bundle is added on `sie-config` between our epoch read and our bundle list read, we install a bundle set *newer* than the hash reflects. The next poll tick sees `remote_hash != stored_hash` and re-fetches — a cheap self-heal. The inverse — storing a hash that's *newer* than the bundles we actually installed — would silently wedge the gateway on a stale registry, which is what the bundle-hash mechanism exists to prevent.

On failure (DNS, 5xx, timeout, decode error, partial apply):

- Increments `sie_gateway_config_bootstrap_failures_total`.
- Sleeps with exponential backoff, initial 1s, doubling to a 60s cap.
- After 10 failed attempts or 5 minutes of sustained failure, sets `sie_gateway_config_bootstrap_degraded` gauge to `1` and escalates logging to `error!`. The gauge clears on the first success.
- The retry loop itself has no attempt ceiling — it keeps trying until one attempt succeeds (at which point the task exits) or the process is killed. `sie-config` is not a hard startup dependency.

During the bootstrap-retry window (before the first successful fetch):

- **`GET /readyz`** follows the **process-readiness** rule above — it is **not** tied to export success or worker health. The gateway still serves whatever models exist in the in-memory registry (typically filesystem-seed-only during this window), and workerless inference requests can still reach the gateway to trigger scale-from-zero.
- `GET /v1/configs/models/{id}` returns only filesystem-seeded models.
- `POST /v1/configs/resolve` for API-only models returns `404`. Admin tooling retries with backoff.
- `ConfigEpoch.get()` typically returns `0` and `GET /v1/configs/models/{id}/status` surfaces `config_epoch: 0`, which admin tooling uses to detect a pre-bootstrap replica. The epoch is not strictly pinned to `0`, however: if the NATS delta subscriber (§4.3) receives a valid `ConfigNotification` with a non-zero `epoch` before the first export succeeds, `ConfigEpoch::set_max` will advance the counter. The `config_bootstrap_degraded` gauge is the more reliable "has export ever succeeded?" signal.

### 4.2 Epoch poll

`state::config_poller::spawn` runs independently of bootstrap with `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL = 30s`. It skips its first tick (to let the initial bootstrap attempt run without contention), then on every tick calls `GET /v1/configs/epoch` on `sie-config` (always sending `SIE_ADMIN_TOKEN` as the bearer — the `/epoch` handler is read-auth and accepts either `SIE_AUTH_TOKEN` or `SIE_ADMIN_TOKEN`, but the gateway-as-client only presents the admin token). The `/epoch` response carries **two** drift signals:

- `epoch` — monotonic counter bumped on every model-config write.
- `bundles_hash` — sha256 fingerprint over `sie-config`'s loaded bundle set. Bundles are filesystem artifacts inside the `sie-config` image, so their effective "version" is redeploy time, which the model-write counter does not observe.

Both signals funnel into the same `bootstrap_once` call — that function re-fetches bundles and models together, which is the correct blanket response to any control-plane drift.

Per-tick decisions:

- If `remote_epoch > local_epoch` **OR** `remote_bundles_hash != stored_bundles_hash` (with the empty-string "registry unavailable" sentinel skipped), the poller calls `bootstrap_once`. On success, `ConfigEpoch` advances and `BundlesHash` is updated.
- If `remote_epoch < local_epoch`, the local counter has run ahead of authority. Most innocent cause: `sie-config` lost its persisted epoch file and restarted at a lower value. Most worrying cause: a forged/untrusted NATS delta wedged the gateway ahead of authority (this is defense-in-depth alongside the producer allowlist — see §4.3). The poller refetches the full export first and only calls `ConfigEpoch::force_set(remote)` if the export succeeded; a failed recovery export keeps `local > remote`, so the next tick re-enters this branch and retries. Note: `ModelRegistry` is append-only for models (but not for bundles — `install_bundles` replaces), so any profiles admitted during the pre-recovery window remain in the registry after recovery — the export replay overlays authority on top of them rather than clearing them. A follow-up restart is the clean fix. Logged at ERROR.
- A remote `bundles_hash` of `""` is the documented "sie-config registry unavailable" sentinel (startup failure or hot reload in flight). The poller skips the hash-mismatch branch in that case rather than thrash fetching against a degraded control plane. The epoch branch still runs normally.
- Transient `/epoch` failures are logged and swallowed. The next tick retries. Neither the local epoch nor the stored bundles hash is reset on poll failure.
- The poller **always** compares local vs. remote, including when `local_epoch == 0` or `stored_bundles_hash == ""`. This matters for fresh clusters: if `sie-config`'s very first write (→ epoch 1) is lost on the wire, the gateway must catch `remote=1 > local=0` and trigger recovery. Gating on "non-zero local" would wedge a fresh gateway until a restart.

Operational consequence: adding or changing a bundle in `sie-config` propagates to running gateways within one `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL` (≤ 30s worst case). No `kubectl rollout restart deployment/sie-gateway` is required — that was true of an earlier revision of this design, which relied on bundles being baked into the gateway image.

### 4.3 Live deltas

Independently of bootstrap and polling, `NatsManager` subscribes to `sie.config.models._all` (Core pub/sub) as soon as the NATS client is ready. For each incoming `ConfigNotification`:

- **Producer-trust check first.** The `producer_id` (wire key `router_id`) must be in the trusted-producer allowlist. Default allowlist is `["sie-config"]`, configurable via `SIE_NATS_CONFIG_TRUSTED_PRODUCERS=a,b,c`. Matching is exact equality OR K8s pod-name prefix (`sie-config` also matches `sie-config-5f7b6d8c-kxwvr` and `sie-config-0`, but not `sie-configuration`). Untrusted notifications are dropped before any registry mutation or epoch advance; a log warning names the rejected producer. Set `SIE_NATS_CONFIG_TRUST_ANY_PRODUCER=true` to disable validation (dev/local only — `main.rs` emits a startup audit warning when this is on).
- An **empty-or-whitespace `model_config` body** (pure epoch bump) advances `ConfigEpoch` via `set_max(notification.epoch)` and returns.
- A non-empty body is parsed as `ModelConfig` YAML. If the parse fails, the epoch is NOT advanced and the event is logged. The poller will catch up.
- On successful parse, `ModelRegistry.add_model_config` is called. If it returns `Ok`, the epoch is advanced. If it returns `Err` (e.g. append-only conflict, unroutable adapter), the epoch is NOT advanced.

`ConfigEpoch::set_max` uses a CAS loop over `AtomicU64`. The value only ever moves forward; a late-arriving lower-epoch delta cannot roll it back. `async_nats::Subscriber` survives reconnects transparently, so the gateway does not need explicit resubscribe logic — any messages published while the subscriber is disconnected are simply lost, which is the gap the poller closes.

## 5. Gateway Read Surface

The gateway serves these endpoints directly out of its in-memory `ModelRegistry`. They always reflect the gateway's own view, which may briefly lag `sie-config` during drift but is self-healing (§4.2).

- `GET /v1/configs/models` — lists every model the gateway currently knows about. Each entry includes `model_id`, `profiles`, `source`.
- `GET /v1/configs/models/{*id}` — dual-purpose wildcard dispatcher:
  - Plain path → YAML document describing the model (`sie_id`, `source`, `bundles`).
  - Path ending in `/status` → JSON worker-ack readiness for the model (see §6).
  - Disambiguation: if the `/status`-stripped ID is a known model, the endpoint returns the status view. Otherwise it falls back to interpreting the full path (including `/status`) as a model ID. `sie-config` refuses to register IDs ending in `/status`, so the ambiguous case cannot arise from legitimate writes.
- `GET /v1/configs/bundles` — lists every bundle the gateway knows about with its `priority`, `adapter_count`, and `connected_workers`.
- `GET /v1/configs/bundles/{id}` — YAML document describing the bundle.
- `POST /v1/configs/resolve` — resolves a `bundle:/model`-style spec to a specific bundle and returns its compatible bundles and profile names.

`sie-config` serves the same shapes (`GET /v1/configs/models`, `/models/{id}`, `/bundles`, `/bundles/{id}`, `POST /v1/configs/resolve`) backed by its authoritative store. In a healthy steady state the two views match.

`GET /v1/configs/models/{id}/status` is gateway-only. `sie-config` has no worker registry; it cannot answer per-replica readiness.

Concurrency on the gateway's `ModelRegistry`:

- Reads are lock-free. `ArcSwap<RegistrySnapshot>` lets readers clone an `Arc` pointer to the current snapshot without blocking.
- Writes (`add_model_config`, `reload`) hold `write_lock: Mutex<()>` across the `load → mutate → store` cycle. Without this lock, two concurrent writers could both load the same base snapshot and silently drop one set of changes.
- `RegistrySnapshot` caches `bundle_config_hashes: HashMap<String, String>`, so the per-request worker-ack hash lookup (§6) is an `O(1)` map read rather than a SHA-256 over tens of KB of JSON.

## 6. Worker-Ack Status (`GET /v1/configs/models/{id}/status`)

Admin tooling uses this endpoint after a `sie-config` write to confirm that configured workers have picked up the new `bundle_config_hash` for each affected bundle.

Response shape:

```json
{
  "model_id": "BAAI/bge-m3",
  "config_epoch": 42,
  "all_bundles_acked": true,
  "no_bundles": false,
  "bundles": [
    {
      "bundle_id": "default",
      "expected_bundle_config_hash": "sha256…",
      "total_eligible_workers": 3,
      "acked_workers": ["worker-1", "worker-2", "worker-3"],
      "pending_workers": [],
      "acked": true
    }
  ],
  "source": "gateway-registry"
}
```

Computation rules:

- **Per-replica only.** The endpoint reports the worker registry state on this specific gateway pod. Fleet-wide readiness is the union across replicas; admin tooling fans out.
- **Case-sensitive bundle match.** A worker is counted as eligible only if `worker.bundle == bundle_id` exactly. Workers whose `bundle` field does not match exactly are skipped entirely — they contribute to neither `total_eligible_workers` nor `pending_workers`. The expected hash is computed against the canonical bundle ID from the registry, and the fleet is case-consistent in practice.
- **Healthy-only.** Unhealthy workers (per `worker.healthy()`) are skipped entirely; they contribute to neither `total_eligible_workers` nor either worker list.
- **Zero-bundle models.** A model with no routable bundles is reported as `all_bundles_acked: false` and `no_bundles: true`. Returning `true` for "nothing to ack" would silently tell admin tooling "fully deployed" when there is nothing deployed.
- **`config_epoch` field.** Surfaces the gateway's local `ConfigEpoch` so callers can tell whether this replica has caught up to a recent write (`config_epoch` lower than the write's returned epoch means this replica is still catching up).

## 7. Cross-Service Hash Parity

`bundle_config_hash` is computed independently by `sie-config` and the gateway, and also by workers. For the admin-tooling readiness flow to work, all three must produce byte-identical hashes for the same config.

The hash is a SHA-256 over a JSON-serialized, sort-keys representation of a structured object. The outer shape is an array of models, each with `sie_id` and `profiles: [{name, config: {...4 fields...}}]`, where the inner `config` for each profile is strictly the four routable-profile fields: `adapter_path`, `max_batch_tokens`, `compute_precision`, `adapter_options`. Any field outside that whitelist is excluded from the hash so that non-routable edits (e.g. comments, description-style metadata) cannot unnecessarily invalidate worker acks. Python uses `orjson.dumps(..., OPT_SORT_KEYS)`; Rust mirrors this via `serde_json::to_vec` over `BTreeMap`-backed canonical types.

`adapter_options` is canonicalized before hashing:

- Python (`ModelRegistry.compute_bundle_config_hash`):

  ```python
  if isinstance(adapter_opts, dict) and not any(adapter_opts.values()):
      adapter_opts = None
  ```

- Rust (`CanonicalProfile::from_profile` → `canonicalize_adapter_options`): if `adapter_options` is an object and every value is Python-falsy (`null`, `false`, `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `[]`, `{}`), it is replaced with `None`; otherwise the value is preserved as-is.

The Rust predicate is intentionally a mirror of Python's `not any(values)`. Any divergence here would make the gateway's `expected_bundle_config_hash` in §6 disagree with every worker's advertised hash, and workers would sit in `pending_workers` indefinitely for any model whose config contained a value like `{"flag": 0}`.

## 8. Messaging Layers

NATS provides two messaging layers and this system uses both. The distinction matters for failure analysis.

- **NATS Core pub/sub** is fire-and-forget. A publisher sends a message on a subject; any subscriber currently connected receives it. If the subscriber is disconnected at that instant, the message is gone. No replay, no persistence, no acks.
- **JetStream** is a persistence layer over Core. Messages are stored, consumers get at-least-once delivery with acks, redelivery, and backpressure.

Per-subject transport:

| Path | Subject pattern | Transport | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inference work | `sie.work.{model}.{pool}` | JetStream | Durability and max-delivery semantics required. Work-item payload is msgpack. One stream per pool (`WORK_POOL_{pool}`) captures all models; see §8.2. |
| Inference results | `_INBOX.{router_id}.{request_id}` | NATS Core | Gateway is waiting synchronously; a brief blip after publish but before delivery means the result is lost and the client retries (the gateway returns `503` with `X-SIE-Error-Code: MODEL_LOADING` and `Retry-After: 5` — see §2). Result payload is msgpack. |
| Config deltas | `sie.config.models.{bundle}`, `sie.config.models._all` | NATS Core | Lightweight fan-out. Durability comes from the snapshot/export path (§4), not the bus. JSON payload (control plane, not hot path). Workers subscribe per-bundle; the gateway subscribes on `_all`. |
| Worker health | `sie.health.>` | NATS Core | Ephemeral, last-heartbeat-wins. The gateway subscribes in `health_mode=nats` (see `discovery/nats_health.rs`); the **default `health_mode=ws`** uses the WebSocket path, and a NATS-mode publisher is not present in the current worker code. Until a worker-side publisher is added, NATS health mode is effectively a no-op consumer. |
| DLQ advisories | `$JS.EVENT.ADVISORY.CONSUMER.MAX_DELIVERIES.>` | NATS Core (advisory) | JetStream emits these; the gateway subscribes in `queue/dlq.rs`. |
| DLQ storage | `sie.dlq.{model_token}` | JetStream | Single stream `DEAD_LETTERS` (Limits retention, memory storage, 24 h `max_age`) captures `sie.dlq.>`. `model_token` is derived from the advisory's original work subject by taking the model segment and replacing `/` with `_`. |

### 8.2 Work-stream configuration and the model-ID constraint

The gateway's `ensure_stream` (per pool, called lazily on first publish) creates a JetStream stream with:

```
name:      WORK_POOL_{pool}
subjects:  ["sie.work.*.{pool}"]
retention: WorkQueue
storage:   Memory
max_age:   60s  (gateway-side)
max_msgs:  100_000
```

The Python worker (`sie_server.nats_pull_loop`) independently calls `add_stream` with the **same** name but a **different default `max_age` of 120 s** (`SIE_STREAM_MAX_AGE_S`). `get_or_create_stream` / `add_stream` does not update an existing stream's config, so whichever side races to the broker first wins. To avoid drift, pick one owner (either the gateway or the worker); the Helm values should set `SIE_STREAM_MAX_AGE_S` on workers to match the gateway's constant, or the gateway should read the same env.

The stream's subject filter `sie.work.*.{pool}` matches **exactly one token** in the model position. NATS subject tokens legally contain `/`, so `BAAI/bge-m3` works directly. They cannot contain `.`, `*`, `>`, or whitespace, so any model whose `sie_id` contains one of those characters would — without normalization — expand into multiple tokens, not match the stream filter, and get rejected at the broker.

To prevent that, the Rust gateway's `work_subject(model, pool)` in `packages/sie_gateway/src/queue/publisher.rs` calls a private `normalize_model_id` helper that mirrors the Python SDK (`sie_sdk.queue_types.normalize_model_id`): `/` → `__`, `.` → `_dot_`, and `*`/`>`/space → `_`. So `vidore/colqwen2.5-v0.2` publishes on `sie.work.vidore__colqwen2_dot_5-v0_dot_2.default` — exactly four tokens, matches the consumer filter. The DLQ token extractor in `queue/dlq.rs` splits the advisory subject on `.` and takes `parts[2]`, which with the normalization in place is already a single safe token; the existing `/` → `_` replacement there is now a no-op for correctly published subjects and a fallback for any legacy un-normalized messages still in-flight at the time of upgrade.

### 8.3 Publisher/consumer ownership

Publishers and consumers:

- **Config deltas**: published exclusively by `sie-config`. The gateway's `NatsManager` is subscribe-only on `_all` and never publishes on these subjects. Delta payload includes a `router_id` field whose value is `sie-config`'s pod/host identifier. The Rust gateway deserializes this field into a struct member named `producer_id`; `router_id` is declared as a `#[serde(alias)]` so both the current `router_id` wire name and any legacy `producer_id` name parse cleanly.
- **Queue work**: published exclusively by the gateway. Consumed by workers.
- **Results**: published exclusively by workers. Consumed by the originating gateway.

The `ConfigNotification` JSON payload carries the following fields, verified against `packages/sie_gateway/src/nats/manager.rs` and `packages/sie_config/src/sie_config/nats_publisher.py`:

- `router_id` on the wire (Python publisher key). The Rust gateway parses this into a struct field named `producer_id`; `router_id` is declared as a `#[serde(alias)]` on the Rust side for forward compatibility.
- `bundle_id`, `epoch`, `bundle_config_hash`, `model_id`.
- `profiles_added` — list of profile names created by this write.
- `model_config` — raw YAML string of the full model config.
- `affected_bundles` — list of every bundle affected by this write. Each affected bundle receives its own message, so a `_all` subscriber sees N messages per write with their respective `bundle_id` / `bundle_config_hash` populated.

### 8.4 Serialization formats

The hot path is always **msgpack** (`rmp_serde` on the gateway, `msgpack-python` / `msgpack-numpy` on workers). Specifically:

- `WorkItem` (gateway → worker on JetStream): msgpack.
- `WorkResult` (worker → gateway on the inbox subject): msgpack. Numpy arrays use `msgpack-numpy`'s extension-free encoding (maps with a `nd: true` sentinel + `dtype`, `shape`, `data`). The gateway transcodes to native JSON arrays only when the client's `Accept` header asks for JSON.

JSON (`serde_json`) is used where payloads are low-frequency or human-oriented:

- Control plane: `POST /v1/configs/models` body, `GET /v1/configs/export` response, `GET /v1/configs/epoch` response.
- NATS config deltas: `ConfigNotification` is JSON.
- Worker-ack status endpoint responses.
- Operator-visible APIs: pool management, `/v1/models`, `/health`, `/metrics`.
- Inference request/response envelopes, when the client opts into JSON via `Content-Type` / `Accept`. SDK clients typically use msgpack end-to-end.

## 9. Storage and Persistence

`sie-config` is the only service that persists configuration. Its backing store is:

- `{base_dir}/models/{model_id_with_slash_replaced_by_double_underscore}.yaml` — one YAML file per model.
- `{base_dir}/epoch` — a plain-text integer, monotonically incremented by `increment_epoch`.

Backend selection is URL-driven (`sie_sdk.storage.get_storage_backend`):

- Local filesystem (default).
- `s3://bucket/prefix` — S3.
- `gs://bucket/prefix` — GCS.

The **local** backend's `write_text` is atomic: it writes via `tempfile.mkstemp` in the same directory as the destination, `fsync`s, then `Path.replace`s. A mid-write crash cannot leave the destination truncated or empty. The cloud backends (`S3Backend`, `GCSBackend`) implement `write_text` as a single `put_object` / `upload_from_string`; object-store PUTs are last-writer-wins and observably atomic at the object level, but they do not use the tempfile + replace pattern. The atomicity property matters most for the `epoch` file: `ConfigStore.read_epoch` silently maps a malformed or empty integer to `0`, so a zero-byte epoch file would collapse the drift-detection mechanism (`remote == local == 0` would read as "in sync forever").

`ConfigStore.increment_epoch` is a naive read-modify-write. Its single-writer assumption is enforced at the FastAPI layer by the per-app write lock (§3).

The gateway has no persistent config store. `SIE_CONFIG_STORE_DIR` and `SIE_CONFIG_RESTORE` are `sie-config`-only and are not part of the gateway's env surface. The only persistent-looking inputs on the gateway are the optional filesystem seed directories (`SIE_BUNDLES_DIR`, `SIE_MODELS_DIR`); these are unset in the default deploy, where bundles and models are pulled from `sie-config` at startup, and only become non-empty when the `gateway.embeddedConfigs` / `gateway.configMap` overlays explicitly mount one.

## 10. Deployment Topology

- `sie-gateway` and `sie-config` are separate Kubernetes Deployments with separate images, built via `tools/mise_tasks/docker_task.py` (invoked as `mise run docker --{gateway,config,bake}`). On a `v*` git tag, `.github/workflows/release-docker.yml` publishes `ghcr.io/superlinked/sie-{config,gateway}:<tag>` and the per-platform/bundle `sie-server:<tag>-<platform>-<bundle>` matrix (plus floating `:latest` variants) to GHCR, which the Helm chart consumes by default. The `aws_docker`/`aws_deploy` tasks handle manual pushes to ECR/AR for cluster-local iteration.
- `sie-config` runs as **a single replica**. Multi-replica is blocked by the in-memory idempotency cache (see §11 "Known operational caveats"). Config persistence is opt-in: when `config.configStore.enabled: true` in the Helm values, a PVC is mounted at `/var/lib/sie-config` (default mount path) and `SIE_CONFIG_STORE_DIR` / `SIE_CONFIG_RESTORE` are set so the store survives pod restarts; with the default `enabled: false`, the store is ephemeral (backed by the pod filesystem) and a pod restart resets the epoch to 0 and drops every API-added model — `sie-config` does not subscribe to NATS (it is the sole publisher) so there is no replay path, and the registry rebuilds from the image-baked `/app/bundles` + `/app/models` baseline only. Every gateway replica's `state::config_poller` then detects `remote_epoch < local_epoch` and force-resets to match the restarted `sie-config`, picking up whatever baseline it now advertises. Operators who need API-added models to survive `sie-config` restarts must set `config.configStore.enabled: true`. The Helm chart (`deploy/helm/sie-cluster/values.yaml`) documents the SPOF posture.
- `sie-gateway` scales horizontally. Each replica maintains its own in-memory `ModelRegistry` and its own `ConfigEpoch`. They all converge on the same state via a combination of bootstrap, deltas, and the poller; they do not coordinate with each other.
- Bundles live on `sie-config`'s filesystem at `SIE_BUNDLES_DIR` (default `/app/bundles`, set via `sharedPaths.bundlesDir`) and are baked into its image. `sie-config` reads them at startup, validates writes against them, and re-serves them over HTTP at `GET /v1/configs/bundles{,/{id}}`. The gateway fetches that surface during `state::config_bootstrap::bootstrap` and installs it via `ModelRegistry::install_bundles` — there is no second copy. The legacy `gateway.embeddedConfigs` / `gateway.configMap` overlays still exist for the rare case of running the gateway without `sie-config` (e.g., self-contained smoke tests); they mount a ConfigMap at `/configs/bundles` which the registry's filesystem reload picks up before the (no-op) bootstrap runs. In all cases, updating bundles is a `sie-config` redeploy and the gateway picks up the change on its next bootstrap or poller-driven reconcile, not via a runtime API call.
- Pools are stored in Kubernetes `ConfigMap`s and `Lease`s read/written by the gateway. `sie-config` is not involved in pool management.
- NATS / JetStream runs as its own workload. The gateway's `NatsManager` builds `async_nats::ConnectOptions` with `retry_on_initial_connect()` so the process does not fail to start if NATS is briefly unavailable; reconnect behavior after initial connect relies on `async-nats`'s default policy (indefinite reconnect with backoff).

## 11. Known Operational Caveats

1. **`sie-config` is a single point of failure for the control plane.** While the pod is down, config writes, authoritative config reads, and gateway catch-up fetches all fail. **The inference hot path is unaffected** — it never touches `sie-config`. New gateway pods enter the soft-degraded bootstrap-retry state (§4.1), serve filesystem-seed traffic until `sie-config` is reachable, and return **`200 ok`** from **`GET /readyz`** once the process is serving. The SPOF is rooted in `_IdempotencyState` (in-memory, per-process). Multi-replica requires moving idempotency state to a shared backend (Redis, JetStream KV, a DB row per key). Until then, `replicas: 1` is a deliberate trade of availability for a correct idempotency contract.

2. **Config deltas use NATS Core pub/sub; deltas published during a gateway-NATS disconnect are lost.** Recovery is automatic via the epoch poller (§4.2). The worst-case staleness window is `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL` plus one export round-trip. No pod restart is required. Shortening `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL` trades load on `sie-config` for recovery time.

3. **Bootstrap is background-retried, not blocking.** A gateway started while `sie-config` is unreachable will serve filesystem-seed traffic immediately. API-added models are missing until the first successful export. `ConfigEpoch` typically stays at `0` during this window — but a NATS delta that arrives before the first export can move it above `0`, so admin tooling should use the `sie_gateway_config_bootstrap_degraded` gauge (set after 10 failed attempts or 5 minutes of sustained failure, cleared on first success) as the authoritative "has this replica ever reconciled with `sie-config`?" signal rather than `config_epoch == 0`. **`GET /readyz` does not encode bootstrap completion or worker health**; it is process readiness (§4).

4. **Partial NATS publish on `sie-config`.** If a write succeeds on disk and in the registry but the NATS publish fails for a subset of affected bundles, `sie-config` still returns `201` (or `200` for no-op replays) with a structured `warnings` entry naming the failed bundles. Workers on those bundles stay on the previous epoch until the gateway poller triggers a re-export.

5. **`POST /v1/configs/models` on the gateway returns `405 Method Not Allowed`.** There is no custom body and no redirect pointer. Tooling that still targets the gateway for writes must be updated to call `SIE_CONFIG_SERVICE_URL` directly.

6. **Write-response shape dropped worker-readiness fields.** `sie-config`'s `POST /v1/configs/models` response does not include `worker_ack_pending` / `acked_workers` / `pending_workers`. Admin tooling polls `GET /v1/configs/models/{id}/status` on each gateway replica instead (§6).

7. **Bundles are filesystem-only on `sie-config`.** There is no bundle-write API. Bundles change by redeploying the `sie-config` image (and the worker image, since adapters referenced in a bundle live in the worker). The gateway no longer bakes bundles — it fetches them from `sie-config` at bootstrap and re-fetches on any `bundles_hash` drift (§4.2) — so a bundle addition propagates to running gateway replicas within one `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL` without a gateway redeploy. The natural deploy order is `sie-config` first (so the new bundle is advertised), then workers for the new bundle (so routable instances exist when the gateway learns about the bundle).

   Side effect of this design: `sie-config` is a **cold-start** dependency for gateway replicas.

   - A fresh replica that cannot reach `sie-config` starts with zero bundles AND zero models.
   - Typed inference requests (i.e., any caller that does not pin a pool) will return `404 model not found` until bootstrap completes.
   - The empty-registry fallback described in §2 only fires for callers that explicitly pin a pool via `X-SIE-Pool` — the proxy falls back to the caller-supplied bundle or `"default"`, so a warm pool stays reachable through a cold gateway.
   - An already-running replica is NOT affected by a `sie-config` outage: it keeps serving its last-known bundle set and receives model deltas over NATS when `sie-config` recovers.

   The `gateway.embeddedConfigs` / `gateway.configMap` Helm overlays remain available as an escape hatch that statically seeds the registry and eliminates the cold-start dependency, at the cost of losing live bundle resync.

8. **`registry_unavailable` (503) on `sie-config`.** (This is **`sie-config`'s** `/readyz`, not the gateway's — same path string, different process.) If the `ModelRegistry` failed to initialize (e.g. malformed bundle YAML), `sie-config`'s `/readyz` returns 503 and every registry-dependent endpoint (`/v1/configs/models`, `/v1/configs/models/{id}`, `/v1/configs/bundles`, `/v1/configs/bundles/{id}`, `/v1/configs/resolve`, `POST /v1/configs/models`, `/v1/configs/export`) returns 503 with a structured `registry_unavailable` error body. `/epoch` is intentionally independent of the registry (it reads the epoch file directly), so the gateway's poller can still discover that `sie-config` is up but not serving — admin tooling should treat **`sie-config` `/readyz=503`** plus **`/epoch=200`** as "control plane is alive but wedged; inspect logs".

## 12. Interaction Rules (Invariants)

- Client SDKs call the gateway for inference, never `sie-config`.
- Admin/config tooling calls `sie-config` for writes.
- The gateway is not a config write authority. `POST /v1/configs/models` is not registered; requests get `405 Method Not Allowed`.
- `sie-config` does not proxy inference traffic.
- Workers do not become the config authority.
- NATS / JetStream is the runtime bus. Kubernetes coordinates pools, not inference.
- `sie-config` is the sole publisher on `sie.config.models.*`. The gateway is subscribe-only.
- The gateway's `ConfigEpoch` is not a source of truth; it is a local caching counter advanced by bootstrap, deltas, and the poller. `sie-config`'s `/epoch` endpoint is authoritative.
- `GET /v1/configs/export` is not an optimization. It is the only way a gateway can realign with `sie-config` after missed deltas.

## 13. Environment Variables

Gateway (`sie-gateway`):

- `SIE_BUNDLES_DIR`, `SIE_MODELS_DIR` — optional filesystem seed paths. Unset by default; only set by the `gateway.embeddedConfigs` / `gateway.configMap` Helm overlays which mount a ConfigMap at `/configs/{bundles,models}`. When unset, the registry's filesystem reload finds nothing and `state::config_bootstrap` fills both bundle and model state from `sie-config`.
- `SIE_CONFIG_SERVICE_URL` — base URL of `sie-config`. If unset, the bootstrap and poller tasks no-op and the gateway runs with whatever the (optional) filesystem seed loaded — typically empty in the default deploy, which means **no models will be served**. This is intended for local single-process tests only.
- `SIE_ADMIN_TOKEN` — (1) bearer token the gateway-as-client presents on `GET /v1/configs/export` and `GET /v1/configs/epoch`; (2) the token that `AuthLayer` requires for admin-gated mutations on the gateway itself (`POST/PUT/DELETE` on `/v1/configs/*`, `/v1/admin/*`, `/v1/pools/*`). If empty and the matching inbound request targets an admin path, the middleware fails closed with `403`. On outbound calls, if empty, no `Authorization` header is sent (so `sie-config` must either be unauthenticated or the gateway will fail with `401`/`403`).
- `SIE_AUTH_TOKEN` / `SIE_AUTH_TOKENS` — tokens accepted by the gateway's own inference API (`/v1/encode`, `/v1/score`, `/v1/extract`) and for read-side pool/config routes. Not used for outbound calls to `sie-config`. When `SIE_AUTH_MODE` enables auth but this list is empty, every non-probe request returns `500`.
- `SIE_AUTH_MODE` — `token` (alias: `static`) enforces auth; `none` (default) disables it. Typos are fail-open-to-bypass by design; `audit_auth` logs a startup error naming the bad value so operators see it in `kubectl logs`.
- `SIE_AUTH_EXEMPT_OPERATIONAL` — when `true`, `/`, `/health`, `/metrics`, and `/ws/*` are exempt from auth (they expose worker URLs, bundle assignments, queue depth, GPU inventory — treat as sensitive). Default `false`. **`/healthz` and `/readyz` are always exempt from auth** so kubelet probes never fail with **`401`/`403`** because of a missing bearer token. `/readyz` reports process readiness only; worker health remains visible through `/health` and inference responses.
- `SIE_NATS_CONFIG_TRUSTED_PRODUCERS` — comma-separated producer allowlist for `sie.config.models._all`. Default `sie-config`. Matching is exact OR K8s pod-name prefix (see §4.3). Untrusted notifications are dropped; the `config_poller` still closes the gap.
- `SIE_NATS_CONFIG_TRUST_ANY_PRODUCER` — `true` disables producer validation entirely. Intended for local/dev. `main.rs` emits a startup audit warning when on.
- NATS connection variables per the existing gateway configuration.

Config service (`sie-config`):

- `SIE_ADMIN_TOKEN` — write-auth. Without it, writes are rejected if `SIE_AUTH_TOKEN` is also set (inference token cannot implicitly grant write access). If neither token is set, writes are accepted unauthenticated — dev/local only; production always sets `SIE_ADMIN_TOKEN`.
- `SIE_AUTH_TOKEN` — read-auth. Optional.
- `SIE_NATS_URL` — NATS broker URL. Publisher degrades gracefully if unreachable; mutations are blocked with `503` while the publisher is configured but disconnected.
- `SIE_CONFIG_STORE_DIR` — base directory for the on-disk config store. When the Helm `config.configStore.enabled` flag is true, this is set to the mounted PVC path and `SIE_CONFIG_RESTORE=true` enables startup replay from the store into the in-memory registry.
- `SIE_BUNDLES_DIR`, `SIE_MODELS_DIR` — bundle and model source directories. **`sie-config` is the source of truth**: it reads these at startup, validates writes against them, and re-serves the bundle list at `GET /v1/configs/bundles` for the gateway's bootstrap. Defaults via `sharedPaths.{bundlesDir,modelsDir}` (`/app/bundles`, `/app/models`) and image-baked.
- `SIE_LOG_LEVEL`, `SIE_LOG_JSON` — log verbosity and structured-JSON toggle (both also exposed as CLI flags).

## 14. Endpoint Reference

### `sie-gateway`

Inference (queue-only):

- `POST /v1/encode/{*model}`
- `POST /v1/score/{*model}`
- `POST /v1/extract/{*model}`
- `POST /v1/embeddings` — OpenAI JSON compatibility layer over encode (string or list of strings); see §2.

Config (read-side only):

- `GET /v1/configs/models`
- `GET /v1/configs/models/{*id}` — model YAML, or worker-ack status for `…/status` suffix.
- `GET /v1/configs/bundles`
- `GET /v1/configs/bundles/{id}`
- `POST /v1/configs/resolve`

Pools and operator:

- `GET /v1/pools`, `POST /v1/pools`, `GET /v1/pools/{name}`, `POST /v1/pools/{name}/renew`, `DELETE /v1/pools/{name}`
- `GET /v1/models`, `GET /v1/models/{*model}` — model catalogue. JSON objects mirror `sie_server` **`ModelInfo`** shape (including `inputs`, `outputs`, `dims`, `profiles`, worker-derived `loaded` / `state`, optional `last_error`, …). An unknown `model` id returns **`404`** with **`{"detail":{"code":"MODEL_NOT_FOUND",...}}`** (same envelope style as FastAPI validation errors on `sie_server`).
- `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz`, `GET /health`
- `GET /metrics`
- `GET /ws/cluster-status`
- `GET /` — HTML status page (operator-facing, not a programmatic API).

Not registered on the gateway: `POST /v1/configs/models`, `GET /v1/configs/export`, `GET /v1/configs/epoch`. The export and epoch endpoints are consumed by the gateway as a client of `sie-config`.

### `sie-config`

Config writes (admin auth):

- `POST /v1/configs/models`
- `GET /v1/configs/export`

Config reads (read auth unless noted):

- `GET /v1/configs/models`
- `GET /v1/configs/models/{model_id:path}`
- `GET /v1/configs/bundles`
- `GET /v1/configs/bundles/{bundle_id}`
- `POST /v1/configs/resolve`
- `GET /v1/configs/epoch`

`sie-config` does not serve `GET /v1/configs/models/{id}/status`. That endpoint is gateway-only by design (no worker registry on `sie-config`).

## 15. Metrics

Both services expose Prometheus metrics on `GET /metrics`. The gateway uses the `prometheus` Rust crate; `sie-config` uses `prometheus-client` (matches `sie-server`'s library choice). All metric names use the `sie_gateway_` or `sie_config_` prefix to make cross-service dashboards unambiguous.

### 15.1 Request and latency — gateway

Emitted from a Tower middleware (`MetricsLayer` in `middleware/metrics.rs`) that wraps the proxy routes. Putting it in middleware rather than inline in handlers is the reason these counters now cover every response including early rejections (validation, auth, capacity, timeout) — previously ~27 exit paths in `handlers/proxy.rs` were silently skipping the counter bump.

- `sie_gateway_requests_total{endpoint,status,machine_profile}` — counter.
- `sie_gateway_request_latency_seconds{endpoint,machine_profile}` — histogram. Wall-clock from middleware entry to response.

### 15.2 Routing outcomes — gateway

- `sie_gateway_provisioning_responses_total{machine_profile}` — counter. `202 Accepted` returned when no ready worker exists; paired with `sie_gateway_pending_demand` for KEDA scale-up.
- `sie_gateway_rejected_requests_total{machine_profile,bundle,reason}` — counter. In-handler emission because the `reason` label (`timeout`, `capacity`, `no_workers`, ...) is too granular for the middleware.
- `sie_gateway_pending_demand{machine_profile,bundle}` — gauge. KEDA trigger. Cleared by `clear_fulfilled_demand` when healthy workers appear.
- `sie_gateway_active_lease_gpus{machine_profile,bundle}` — gauge. KEDA trigger. Recomputed from the current pool list on every `update_pool_metrics`.

### 15.3 Worker and model state — gateway

- `sie_gateway_workers{status}` — gauge, healthy/unhealthy counts.
- `sie_gateway_worker_queue_depth{worker,machine_profile,bundle}` — gauge.
- `sie_gateway_worker_memory_used_bytes{worker,machine_profile,bundle}` — gauge.
- `sie_gateway_model_workers{model}` — gauge, worker count per model.

### 15.4 Queue and DLQ — gateway

- `sie_gateway_queue_publish_seconds{operation}` — histogram, JetStream publish latency.
- `sie_gateway_queue_items_published{operation}` — histogram, batch size.
- `sie_gateway_queue_result_wait_seconds{operation}` — histogram, time from publish to result receipt on the NATS Core inbox.
- `sie_gateway_queue_payload_offloads_total` — counter, large-payload offload events.
- `sie_gateway_queue_inbox_skips_total` — counter, fast-path request-id skips on the inbox.
- `sie_gateway_queue_ack_failures_total` — counter, fire-and-forget JetStream ack monitoring.
- `sie_gateway_dlq_events_total{stream,consumer}` — counter, **successful** DLQ forwards.
- `sie_gateway_dlq_republish_failures_total{stream,consumer}` — counter, DLQ publish failures. Companion to the success counter; without it a DLQ publish outage was invisible on the existing metric.

### 15.5 Pool lifecycle — gateway

- `sie_gateway_pool_events_total{event}` — counter. `event` is one of `created`, `updated`, `renewed`, `deleted`, `expired`. Complements the `active_lease_gpus` gauge: the gauge shows current state, this counter shows the rate of churn. A 5-minute rate over `event="expired"` catches runaway expirations; a sustained `event="created"` rate catches runaway pool creation.

### 15.6 Config plane — gateway

- `sie_gateway_config_bootstrap_failures_total` — counter. Background bootstrap retry failures (see §10).
- `sie_gateway_config_bootstrap_degraded` — gauge, `0` or `1`. Set to `1` once the gateway has been serving the filesystem seed past the degraded threshold; cleared on the first successful bootstrap.
- `sie_gateway_config_epoch` — gauge. Highest-known control-plane epoch on this gateway. Updated by bootstrap fetch, NATS Core delta handler, and the epoch poller. Pairs with `sie_config_epoch` for drift alerting (§15.9).
- `sie_gateway_config_deltas_total{kind,result}` — counter. NATS Core config-delta processing outcomes. `kind` is the delta kind (`epoch_bump`, `model_added`); `result` is `applied`, `parse_error`, `apply_error`, or `rejected_untrusted`.
- `sie_gateway_nats_connected` — gauge, `0` or `1`. Flipped by the NATS client's connect/disconnect event callbacks. Unlabeled: the gateway uses a single `async-nats` client for JetStream (work + results) and NATS Core (config deltas), so a single gauge accurately represents the only connection-state dimension that exists today. If we later split clients per purpose, re-introduce a `stream` label at that point.

### 15.7 Request and latency — sie-config

Emitted from a Starlette ASGI middleware (`_PrometheusHTTPMiddleware` in `app_factory.py`) that wraps the FastAPI app. The `path` label is the **FastAPI route template** (e.g. `/v1/configs/models/{model_id:path}`), not the raw URL — otherwise per-model reads would each produce their own time series. The middleware intentionally skips `/metrics` itself so scrape traffic does not pollute the counter.

- `sie_config_http_requests_total{method,path,status}` — counter.
- `sie_config_http_request_duration_seconds{method,path}` — histogram. Wall-clock end-to-end inside the ASGI app.

### 15.8 Config plane state — sie-config

- `sie_config_epoch` — gauge. Authoritative epoch persisted in `ConfigStore`. Seeded on startup from `ConfigStore.read_epoch`, updated on every successful `increment_epoch`. `0` when no `ConfigStore` is configured (standalone / test), which is the correct "never bumped" value.
- `sie_config_models_total{source}` — gauge. `source` is `api` (added via `POST /v1/configs/models`, persisted in `ConfigStore`) or `filesystem` (seeded from the on-disk `bundles/` + `models/` directories). Refreshed on each successful write.
- `sie_config_nats_connected` — gauge, `0` or `1`. Flipped by `NatsPublisher` in the connect / disconnect / reconnect callbacks.
- `sie_config_nats_publishes_total{result}` — counter. One sample per `publish_config_notification` call. `result` is `success`, `partial`, or `failure`. `partial` means at least one bundle subject succeeded and at least one failed — operators treat this differently from `failure` because the gateway poller closes a partial gap within ~30 s.
- `sie_config_store_writes_total{op,result}` — counter. `op` is `write_model` or `increment_epoch`; `result` is `success` or `failure`. A sustained `failure` rate is a PVC / disk-backend issue.

### 15.9 Cross-service drift alert

The most important alert across both services. Fires when any gateway's view of the control plane lags the authoritative epoch published by `sie-config`:

```promql
(sie_config_epoch - on() sie_gateway_config_epoch) > 0
```

Sustained non-zero for >1 minute means either NATS Core deltas are not flowing (pub/sub has no replay, so a disconnected gateway silently falls behind) or the epoch poller is stuck. The poller normally closes this gap within its poll interval regardless of NATS health, so a sustained alert here is always an actionable incident.

## 16. Worked Example: end-to-end request

This section walks a concrete `encode` request through the system so the moving parts in §1–§15 have an explicit reference trace.

### 16.1 Bundles and model → bundle resolution

A **bundle** defines which Python adapter modules a worker deployment can run. Two shapes ship today:

**`default` bundle** (priority `10`) — ~37 adapters for smaller BERT-class and cross-encoder models:

```yaml
# bundles/default.yaml
name: default
priority: 10
adapters:
- sie_server.adapters.bert_flash
- sie_server.adapters.bge_m3_flash
- sie_server.adapters.clip
- sie_server.adapters.colbert
- sie_server.adapters.sentence_transformer
- sie_server.adapters.splade_flash
# … 30+ more
```

**`sglang` bundle** (priority `20`) — one adapter for large LLM-based models using the SGLang inference engine:

```yaml
# bundles/sglang.yaml
name: sglang
priority: 20
adapters:
- sie_server.adapters.sglang
```

`ModelRegistry` maps a model to a bundle by matching the model's `adapter_path` module against each bundle's `adapters` list, then preferring the lowest-priority bundle in the match set:

```
Model: BAAI/bge-m3
  adapter_path: sie_server.adapters.bge_m3_flash:BGEM3FlashAdapter
  adapter module: sie_server.adapters.bge_m3_flash
  → matches "default" bundle
  → routes to "default" workers

Model: Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-4B
  adapter_path: sie_server.adapters.sglang:SGLangEmbeddingAdapter
  adapter module: sie_server.adapters.sglang
  → matches "sglang" bundle
  → routes to "sglang" workers
```

This mapping is computed at startup and whenever the model registry reloads (filesystem hot reload, NATS config delta, or successful bootstrap/poll). No per-model hand-wiring.

### 16.2 A single request from client to response

```bash
curl -X POST https://gateway/v1/encode/BAAI/bge-m3 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/msgpack" \
  --data-binary @request.msgpack
```

**Step 1 — Gateway resolves routing** (`handlers/proxy.rs`):

```
Model:    BAAI/bge-m3
Bundle:   default          (bge_m3_flash is in the default bundle)
Pool:     default          (no X-SIE-POOL header, no machine-profile override)
Subject:  sie.work.BAAI__bge-m3.default
Stream:   WORK_POOL_default
```

The work subject is constructed by `work_subject(model, pool)` in `queue/publisher.rs`, which runs the model id through `normalize_model_id` (the Rust mirror of `sie_sdk.queue_types.normalize_model_id`: `/` → `__`, `.` → `_dot_`, `*`/`>`/space → `_`). The result is always exactly four dot-separated tokens so it matches the worker's `sie.work.*.{pool}` consumer filter — this is the guarantee that makes dotted ids like `vidore/colqwen2.5-v0.2` work. The DLQ path extracts the third token from the advisory subject, replaces any leftover `/` with `_` as a legacy fallback, and publishes on `sie.dlq.{model_normalized}` — so `sie.work.BAAI__bge-m3.default` becomes `sie.dlq.BAAI__bge-m3` when a message hits max-deliveries.

**Step 2 — Gateway publishes work items to JetStream** (`queue/publisher.rs`). For a 2-item request the gateway publishes two msgpack work items:

```
WorkItem {
  work_item_id:  "abc-123.0",
  request_id:    "abc-123",
  item_index:    0,
  total_items:   2,
  operation:     "encode",
  model_id:      "BAAI/bge-m3",
  profile_id:    "default",
  pool_name:     "default",
  machine_profile: "l4-spot",
  item:          { "text": "..." },       // or omitted + payload_ref if >1MB
  reply_subject: "_INBOX.gw-1.abc-123",
  bundle_config_hash: "a1b2c3…",
  …
}
```

JetStream publish is fire-and-forget: the gateway buffers publishes to the `async-nats` client and spawns a detached task to drain the acks, so the request handler does not block per-item on the JetStream round-trip. Ack failures are logged and counted via `sie_gateway_queue_ack_failures_total`. Backpressure and no-consumer conditions are caught earlier via a cached stream-info check (`stream_info_cache`), so a stalled stream surfaces as a prompt `503` rather than a stuck request.

In parallel, the gateway registers a `ResultCollector` in its `DashMap<String, ResultCollector>` keyed by `request_id` and subscribes (once, app-wide) to `_INBOX.{router_id}.>` on NATS Core.

**Step 3 — Worker pulls and processes** (`sie-server`):

A worker in the `default` pool pulls the message from `WORK_POOL_default`:

1. Deserializes the msgpack payload.
2. Reads `model_id` and `operation`.
3. Checks whether `BAAI/bge-m3` is already loaded on the GPU; if not, loads it lazily.
4. Runs `BGEM3FlashAdapter` with the input text.
5. Produces a 1024-dimensional embedding (numpy array).
6. Publishes the msgpack-encoded result (with `msgpack-numpy` for the array) on `_INBOX.gw-1.abc-123` (NATS Core).
7. Acks the JetStream message.

Workers are multi-model: one `default` worker can serve BGE-M3, a cross-encoder, CLIP, etc. in interleaved fashion, loading and caching on demand.

**Step 4 — Gateway assembles the response** (`queue/publisher.rs`, `handlers/proxy.rs`):

On each inbox message, the gateway first runs `extract_request_id_fast` — a bounded scan of the raw msgpack bytes that locates the `request_id` (or, for array-shape `WorkResult` payloads, the first string field, which the current codec places at the `request_id` / `work_item_id` position) without a full deserialization. If the extracted ID is not present in the `pending_results` `DashMap`, the message is dropped immediately (already completed, duplicate redelivery, or stale). Only when it is live does the handler run `rmp_serde::from_slice` to decode the full `WorkResult`. This lets the gateway shed redelivered JetStream messages at near-memcmp cost.

Results are stored by `item_index` in the `ResultCollector`, and a oneshot completes when all items have arrived. The gateway then converts the collected msgpack results into the client-requested format — pass-through for `Accept: application/msgpack` or transcoded to JSON (with numpy-array expansion) for `Accept: application/json`.

Response headers include timing information:

```
X-SIE-Version: 0.2.0
X-SIE-Server-Version: 0.2.0
X-SIE-Request-Id: abc-123
X-SIE-Worker: <worker-id>
X-Queue-Publish-Time: 2.1
X-Queue-Wait-Time: 14.6
X-Queue-Time: 15.3
X-Inference-Time: 12.8
X-Tokenization-Time: 1.2
X-Postprocessing-Time: 0.4   # optional; only when the worker reports it
X-Payload-Fetch-Time: 0.0    # optional; only when payload-ref indirection was used
```

(HTTP header names are case-insensitive; the server emits them lowercase.)

### 16.3 Pools and capacity isolation

A **pool** is a group of GPU workers reserved for a specific workload — the answer to "I need guaranteed GPU capacity that isn't shared with other traffic." Every cluster has a `default` pool that uses all available workers. Custom pools are opt-in:

```
POST /v1/pools
{
  "name": "customer-acme",
  "gpus": {"l4-spot": 2},
  "gpu_caps": {"l4-spot": 4},
  "bundle": "sglang",
  "ttl_seconds": 3600
}
```

`gpus` is required capacity; `gpu_caps` is an optional assignment cap. The `default` pool has zero requirements and no caps. Capped workers poll pool status every 10 seconds before NATS pulls. HA gateways sort workers deterministically and persist named-pool assignment status.

Helm publishes canonical machine profiles in `SIE_GATEWAY_CONFIGURED_GPUS` and request aliases in `SIE_GATEWAY_GPU_ALIASES`.

Each pool gets its own JetStream stream (`WORK_POOL_{name}`) with subjects `sie.work.*.{name}`. Workers are deployed with `SIE_POOL={name}` and consume only from their own pool's stream. That is the isolation boundary.

Creating a usable custom pool is a two-step operation: add the pool to Helm values so a `StatefulSet` of workers actually exists with `queuePool`/`SIE_POOL` set to the logical pool name, then register the pool on the gateway via `POST /v1/pools` so it tracks fulfillment and admission. Clients then target the pool with an `X-SIE-POOL: customer-acme` header. Pools expire after their TTL unless renewed with `POST /v1/pools/{name}/renew`; the `default` pool is protected and cannot be deleted.

Model configs registered via the control plane (`sie-config`) are not tied to a pool — they describe what the cluster can serve, not who gets to serve it. Pool membership, worker counts, and GPU types are Helm-driven and independent of the config API.
