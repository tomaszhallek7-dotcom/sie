    This is the canonical format consumed by:
    - Gateway (extracts machine_profile, bundle, loaded_models for routing)
    - sie-top in worker mode (displays full details)

    Attributes:
        timestamp: Unix timestamp of this status snapshot.
        ready: True when worker is ready to accept traffic. Gateway only routes to
            ready workers. False during startup until lifespan completes.
        name: Worker name/identifier.
        machine_profile: Machine profile for routing. In K8s: from SIE_MACHINE_PROFILE env var
            (e.g., "l4-spot"). Standalone: detected GPU type (e.g., "l4").
        pool_name: NATS work-queue pool name (from SIE_POOL env var, e.g., "l4-spot-default").
            Used by the gateway in queue mode to publish to the correct JetStream subject.
            Empty string when not in queue mode or not set.
        gpu_count: Number of GPUs on this worker.
        bundle: Dependency bundle this worker is running (e.g., "default").
        bundle_config_hash: SHA-256 hash of the serialized model configs/profiles
            assigned to this worker's bundle. Used by gateways to gate routing on
            config awareness. Empty string when not yet computed.
        loaded_models: List of model names currently loaded.
        server: Server metadata (version, uptime, etc.).
        gpus: Per-GPU metrics (includes gpu_type for each GPU).
        models: Per-model status.
        max_batch_requests: Maximum number of requests the worker can batch in a
            single inference call (minimum across loaded models).
        counters: Prometheus counter values for QPS calculation.
        histograms: Prometheus histogram data for latency percentiles.
        saturated: Admission backpressure signal for direct-dispatch routing. True when the worker is
            at or above its high-water mark and the gateway should temporarily
            exclude it from the HRW direct-dispatch ring. The worker owns
            hysteresis (90/70 thresholds); the gateway just consumes the bool.
            Defaults to False; missing field on legacy workers means "not saturated".
