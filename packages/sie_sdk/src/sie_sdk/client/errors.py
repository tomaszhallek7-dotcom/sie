class ModelLoadFailedError(ServerError):
    """Error when the server reports a recorded model-load failure.

    Distinct from :class:`ModelLoadingError` — this is raised on the
    first response (no retry budget consumed) when the server returns
    HTTP ``502 MODEL_LOAD_FAILED``. The server uses this code for both:

    - **Permanent-class failures** (``GATED``, ``NOT_FOUND``,
      ``DEPENDENCY``, ``UNKNOWN``) where retrying would waste time and
      operator intervention is required (e.g. set ``HF_TOKEN``, accept
      the model license, upgrade ``transformers``). These carry
      ``permanent=True``.
    - **Transient classes in active cooldown** (``OOM``, ``NETWORK``)
      where the registry is suppressing retries for a finite window so
      the load loop does not hot-spin. These carry ``permanent=False``;
      the failure auto-expires and a subsequent request will trigger a
      fresh load attempt.

    Either way the server omits the ``Retry-After`` header so the SDK
    short-circuits its ``MODEL_LOADING`` retry budget and surfaces the
    error immediately. Callers can either catch :class:`ServerError`
    generally (preserves legacy 5xx handling) or catch
    :class:`ModelLoadFailedError` specifically and branch on
    :attr:`permanent` / :attr:`error_class` for tailored remediation.

    Attributes:
        model: The model that was requested.
        error_class: Server-side classification (``GATED``, ``OOM``,
            ``DEPENDENCY``, ``NOT_FOUND``, ``NETWORK``, ``UNKNOWN``).
            Use this to route to remediation paths (surface an
            "HF_TOKEN" hint for ``GATED``, retry later for ``OOM``).
        permanent: Whether the failure is non-retryable per server
            policy. ``True`` indicates a terminal failure that will not
            auto-clear — an operator must fix the underlying cause.
            ``False`` indicates a server-side cooldown over a transient
            condition; retrying after the cooldown window will succeed
            once the underlying issue resolves.
        attempts: How many load attempts the server has logged.

    can branch on token-budget failures specifically (e.g. truncate the
    input client-side, switch to a longer-context model, or surface a
    targeted error to the end user) without parsing the error code.
