"""Cross-language fixture for worker_id NATS subject normalization.

The gateway (Rust) publishes direct-dispatch work items to
``sie.work.{model}.{pool}.{worker_id}`` and applies its
``normalize_model_id`` to the worker_id before publishing. The Python SDK
helpers (``work_worker_subject``, ``work_worker_stream_subjects``,
``work_worker_stream_name``, ``work_worker_consumer_name``) and the worker
init (``NatsPullLoop.__init__``) now route worker IDs through
:func:`sie_sdk.queue_types.normalize_worker_id`, which delegates to
``normalize_model_id`` for byte-identical output.

If this file diverges from the Rust ``test_worker_id_normalization_cross_language``
fixture in ``packages/sie_gateway/src/queue/publisher.rs``, direct-dispatch
will silently miss every worker whose raw id contains a newly-changed
character — the pool fallback will eventually catch the work item but the
HRW routing decision is wasted.

Workstream G-M5.
